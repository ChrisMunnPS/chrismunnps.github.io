# Christopher Munn Portfolio

This is a modern React portfolio website built with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 Running Locally

To run this application on your local machine, you must use a development server. You cannot open `index.html` directly.

1.  **Install Node.js** (if not already installed).
2.  Open your terminal in this folder.
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5.  Open the link shown in your terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

## 🌐 Deploying to GitHub Pages

This project includes a **GitHub Action** that will automatically deploy your site when you push to GitHub.

1.  Push your code to your GitHub repository (`main` or `master` branch).
2.  The "Deploy to GitHub Pages" action will run automatically (check the **Actions** tab in GitHub).
3.  Once finished, your site will be live at `https://chrismunnPS.github.io`.

**Note:** If the site doesn't load, go to **Settings > Pages** in your repository and ensure the source is set to the **`gh-pages`** branch.
